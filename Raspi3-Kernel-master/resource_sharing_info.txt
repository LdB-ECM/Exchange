GPIO states need to be avaliable
delays don't need a lock
LFB needs a lock
mbox needs a lock
sd is only used by fat.c so doesn't need a lock however if ext is to be implemented a lock
needs to be in place
uarts need locks
init should only execute once
stepper should have a method of checking if the stepper is already in motion
